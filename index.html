        <p>Margarita Munoz is a Geor    gia State University graduate. She pursued a degree in International Economics and Modern Languages.
        Driven by her passion for foreign languages, she pursued her B.S. to further her studies in French, and stumbled into a love for Economics. 
        Fascinated by the relationships between people, culture, and finances allowed her to delve into many disciplines within economics. 
        However, post graduation she spent her time in the accounting field, and realized it was not something she wanted to continue to grow in.</p>
